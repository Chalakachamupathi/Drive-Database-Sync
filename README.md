# Drive-Database-Sync
A Google Drive sync layer for Android SQLite Databases

# How to use
MavenCentral integration is coming as soon as possible.
Until then, clone and import as usual for Android Libraries.

So far as how to integrate this with your project - see Example app and JavaDoc provided.

# Example
The Example application demos putting some data (the current date) in a database, putting the database in Drive, deleting the local database, pulling the database out of Drive, etc. It should give you a basic idea of how to interface with this Library.

# Version notes
Still in activite development, version around ~0.7.

# Credits
Thanks to Google for creating something like this for the old Drive API which inspired me, and again to Google for not updating their demo and motivating me.
